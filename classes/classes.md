# JavaScript Classes: A Complete Guide

Classes in JavaScript provide a cleaner and more powerful way to create reusable object blueprints. They are built on top of JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance and offer a more structured, object-oriented syntax.

## Introduction

JavaScript classes offer a more familiar syntax for creating constructor functions and managing inheritance. They don't introduce a new object-oriented model â€” they are syntactical sugar over the existing prototypal system.

---

## Creating Classes

### Basic Class Syntax

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

```
The constructor method initializes object properties.

You use new to instantiate a class.

Instantiating a Class
```javascript

const alice = new Person("Alice", 30);
console.log(alice.name); // "Alice"
console.log(alice.age);  // 30
```

## Adding Methods
Methods are added inside the class without using the function keyword.

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hi, my name is ${this.name}.`);
  }
}

const bob = new Person("Bob", 25);
bob.greet(); // "Hi, my name is Bob."
```
âœ… Methods are shared across instances via the prototype, saving memory.

## Class Expressions
Classes can also be defined as expressions and assigned to variables.

```javascript
const Animal = class {
  constructor(species) {
    this.species = species;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.species} makes a sound.`);
  }
};

const dog = new Animal("Dog");
dog.speak(); // "Dog makes a sound."
```

Useful for one-off classes or dynamic class creation.

## Getters and Setters
You can define special methods to control property access.

```javascript
class Rectangle {
  constructor(width, height) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }

  get area() {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }

  set dimensions({ width, height }) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }
}

const rect = new Rectangle(10, 5);
console.log(rect.area); // 50

rect.dimensions = { width: 20, height: 10 };
console.log(rect.area); // 200

```

get allows you to access computed properties.

set allows custom logic when setting a property.

## Inheritance

Classes can extend other classes to inherit their behavior.

Subclassing
```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  move() {
    console.log(`${this.name} moves.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  bark() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

const dog = new Dog("Buddy");
dog.move(); // "Buddy moves."
dog.bark(); // "Buddy barks."

```
extends keyword sets up inheritance.

The subclass can define its own methods.

## Using super
The super keyword is used to call methods from the parent class.

```javascript
class Bird extends Animal {
  constructor(name, canFly) {
    super(name);
    this.canFly = canFly;
  }

  fly() {
    if (this.canFly) {
      console.log(`${this.name} is flying!`);
    } else {
      console.log(`${this.name} can't fly.`);
    }
  }
}

const penguin = new Bird("Penguin", false);
penguin.move(); // "Penguin moves."
penguin.fly();  // "Penguin can't fly."
```

## Static Methods and Properties

Static Methods in JavaScript
Static methods are methods that belong to the class itself, rather than to instances of the class. This means you can call them directly on the class, without creating an instance of that class.

Key Points:
Do not have access to instance data (i.e., this refers to the class itself, not an instance).

Useful for utility functions that are related to the class but donâ€™t depend on instance properties.

Called directly on the class (not on instances of the class).

### Syntax:
Static methods are defined with the static keyword inside the class.

## Example: Math Helper
A common use case for static methods is to implement utility functions. For instance, a MathHelper class might have a static method for adding two numbers:

Static Methods
```javascript
class MathHelper {
  static add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

console.log(MathHelper.add(5, 3)); // 8
```

Here, add is a static method that doesnâ€™t need an instance of MathHelper to be called.

## Why Use Static Methods?
	â€¢	Utility or Helper Functions: If the method is meant to perform an operation thatâ€™s related to the class but doesnâ€™t need to interact with instance-specific data (properties), static methods are a great choice.
	â€¢	Factory Methods: Static methods can also serve as factory methods, which create and return instances of a class.

Example: Factory Method

```javascript 
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  static createPerson(name, age) {
    return new Person(name, age);
  }
}

const person1 = Person.createPerson("Alice", 30);
console.log(person1.name);  // "Alice"
```

## Static Properties
```javascript
class Company {
  static companyName = "TechCorp";
}

console.log(Company.companyName); // "TechCorp"
```
Static methods are often utility functions.

Static properties hold constant data for the class.

Private Fields and Methods
Private members use the # prefix and are inaccessible outside the class.

```javascript
class BankAccount {
  #balance = 0;

  constructor(owner) {
    this.owner = owner;
  }

  deposit(amount) {
    this.#balance += amount;
    console.log(`Deposited: $${amount}`);
  }

  getBalance() {
    return this.#balance;
  }
}

const account = new BankAccount("Alex");
account.deposit(100);
console.log(account.getBalance()); // 100
// console.log(account.#balance); // SyntaxError
```
ðŸ”’ Private fields ensure true encapsulation.

## Class Fields
You can declare properties directly inside the class body without the constructor.

```javascript
class User {
  name = "Guest";
  isLoggedIn = false;

  login() {
    this.isLoggedIn = true;
  }
}

const user = new User();
console.log(user.name); // "Guest"
user.login();
console.log(user.isLoggedIn); // true
```

Helps to avoid boilerplate inside constructors.

## Extending Built-in Objects
You can create classes that inherit from built-in types like Array, Error, etc.

Custom Error Example

```javascript
class ValidationError extends Error {
  constructor(message) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "ValidationError";
  }
}

throw new ValidationError("Invalid input!");
```
âš¡ Extending built-ins makes error handling or data structures more powerful.

## Mixing Classes with Objects
You can combine classes with object behaviors using Object.assign().

```javascript
const behaviors = {
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} speaks.`);
  }
};

class Cat {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

Object.assign(Cat.prototype, behaviors);

const cat = new Cat("Whiskers");
cat.speak(); // "Whiskers speaks."
```

Mixins allow sharing behavior without full inheritance.

## Conclusion

JavaScript classes offer a modern, cleaner way to work with prototypes, making it easier to model real-world relationships between objects. By mastering classes, inheritance, static properties, and private fields, you can write more organized and scalable applications.
